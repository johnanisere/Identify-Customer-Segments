# Identify-Customer-Segments

Most Businesses around the world oftentimes have to do some marketing to gain new customers.
In project I used the data provided by Arvato Financial Solutions, a Bertelsman subsidiary company, 
to analyse the demographics data for customers of a mail-order sales company in Germany, 
comparing it against demographics information of the general population.

I also performed customer segmentation by applying unsupervised learning technique to uncovered the demographic characteristics of the core customers.
Identifying the part of the population that best describe the customer base of the company.
In addition to that, I also built a model by applying supervised learning technique using another dataset from a marketing campaign of the company, 
to predict individuals that are most likely to be the potential customer of the company. 

Finally, I participated in a Kaggle competition to evaluate the supervised learning model I created with evaluation metric of AUC for the ROC curve, 
where he ROC curve is created by plotting the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at various threshold settings.
